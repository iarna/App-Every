=head1 NAME

every - Easily create and queue cronjobs from the command line

=head1 INSTALLING

You can fetch a current release as a standalone script with:

    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iarna/App-Every/master/packed/every && chmod a+x every

And see these docs with:

  ./every --help

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Form: every [--help] [-n|--dry-run] [-l] ([num] unit)... [--] program

For example:

    every day dosomething

    every 3 hours dosomething

    every @reboot dosomething

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Create and installs a crontab entry for you from a simple readable
specifier.  To see what crontab the tool will create, pass just --dry-run or
-n and it will print out the crontab entry without installing it.  Crontabs
will be installed in the current user's crontab.  You can view them in the
usual way (ie, crontab -l).

Commands will always be run from the directory you were in when you ran
every, so "./do_something" is perfectly valid.  Further, your path and shell
will be maintained, so feel free to schedule shell commands, or things from
your ~/bin or what not.

The "-l" command provides job locking, so that if your command hasn't exited
by the time cron ticks again, you won't end up with second copy running.

=head1 OPTIONS

--help - Display this page.

--dry-run

-n     - Don't actually install the crontab

-l     - Add locking so that more then one copy can't run at once

num    - Number of the unit, defaults to 1

unit   - Unit can be min(ute)(s), hour(s), day(s), week(s), month(s) or the
name of a day of week, eg tue(sday).

Or instead of a number plus a unit, you can pass in @daily, @weekly, @yearly
or @reboot which will cause your command to be run every day, week, year or
on reboot, respectively.

=head1 JUSTIFICATION

This is intended to be as easy to use as "at", but for recurring jobs rather
then one-offs.  I'd found myself having a bad habit of running tasks in
loops in my shell with sleeps, rather then creating cron entries-- this is
intended to encourage me (and you!) to actually use cron.
